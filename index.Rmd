# Summary: Introduction of ALOS-2
Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2), also called Daichi-2, is a 2,120 kg Japanese satellite launched in 2014.      The satellite contains a 1.2 GHz synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) sensor that is intended to be used for cartography, monitoring of naval traffic and disaster monitoring of Asia and the Pacific.*(Advanced land observing satellite-2 "daichi-2" (Alos-2) 2020)*

# Summary: Sensor on ALOS-2
The PALSAR-2 aboard ALOS-2 is an L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar(SAR) sensor, a microwave sensor that emits L-band radio waves and receives their reflection from the ground to acquire information.*(Alos-2 (advanced land observing satellite-2) / daichi-2 2012) *

The table below shows the observation modes of PALSAR-2 and technical specifications of it:

# Summary: Missions of ALOS-2
The missions of ALOS-2 are in the following:

1. Disaster monitoring

2. Land monitoring

3. Agricultural monitoring

4. Natural resource Exploration

5. Global forest monitoring

# Application: Disaster monitoring
1. ALOS/PALSAR−2 can detect landslides in areas with high vegetation coverage, meeting over 90% of monitoring requirements.*(Shuai Yang et al., 2023)*

2. The validity and applicability of ALOS-2 data in the identification of potential landslides in areas with dense vegetation cover and complex geological conditions were confirmed from the aspects of vegetation cover, topography, field investigation, and comparative analysis of typical landslides.*(Chen Cao et al., 2022)*

3. The bushfire investigation showed that precision of classification of ALOS-2 is 89% based on differences between pre- and post-disaster data.*(S. Mutai and L. Chang, 2020)*

# Application: Global forest monitoring
1. While the L-band (ALOS-2) can detect more types of deforestation, such as clear-cutting and forest fires, when compared to the C-band SAR (Sentinel-1) data.*(Ngo Duc Anh, Vu Anh Tuan, and Truong Tuan Nghia, 2023)*

2. When estimating the area-based aboveground biomass of a temperate forest with dense canopy and intermixing crowns, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 is a preferable option over UAV RGB.*(HASAN AHMED, 2021)*

# Reflection: Challenges of using SAR data
The first SAR instrument was launched into orbit more than 40 years ago, with all-weather, all-time capabilities, SAR was still viewed as a backup option to visual and other sensors.   Modern SAR sensors have several modes and special capabilities.  But there are still a lot of obstacles to overcome :

1. Advanced models on multisource data are needed to reduce uncertainty. 

2. Few benchmark datasets, particularly those with labels

*(Arsenios Tsokas et al., 2022)*

# Reflection
The presentation mainly talked and discussed ALOS-2 with SAR. As it concluded in the previous part, SAR data had contributed to disaster monitoring and global forest monitoring. However, during the literature reading, I found out there are several challenges include the requirement for advanced modelling approaches and limited benchmark datasets. SAR data indeed have large potential on disaster prevention and ecosystem monitoring, but the cooperation of remote sensing techniques and policies should be noticed in the future. Further SAR discussion will be continued in week 8.
